* Analysis Framework                                               :kornobis:
** Design

The first idea was to have only a series of notebooks which are providing an
exhaustive description of an analysis.

PB: Reproducibility / Claritity interface. 
- How to integrate containers in jupyter ?

  > Should we have a specific homemade container per notebook

  >> This hinder part of the interest of containers being "atomical"

  > Only use conda environments (ie one conda environments per notebooks)

  >>> Maybe can be a structure could be, one singularity container with all the
  conda environments of the analysis.

- How to deal with computing ressources demanding parts of the analysis: in
  notebook ? as snakemake rules ?

- Structure:
  Maybe each analysis notebooks could be separeted in a:
  - prior: All requirements needed for the analysis
  - main: The actual analysis
  - Most ressources demanding computations > In snakemake only ? > easyer when
    migrating to cluster.

** Dev
*** DONE Premises [2/2] :0.1:
   CLOSED: [2019-06-13 Thu 09:43] SCHEDULED: <2019-06-30 Sun>

    - [X] Setup a snakemake file launching a jupyter notebooks with papermill
      using a configuration file

    - [X] Define an primary organisation for the jupyter notebooks:
      - 1 for summary
      - 1 for data downloads
      - 1 for general report/figures/tables

*** DONE Add html export :0.2:
    CLOSED: [2019-06-13 Thu 11:23] SCHEDULED: <2019-06-13 Thu>

*** DONE Add singularity support [2/2] :0.3:
    CLOSED: [2019-07-03 Wed 19:05] SCHEDULED: <2019-07-31 Wed>

    - [X] Add container functionality (singularity) in a notebook
      
    - [X] Add container functionality in a snakemake rule

      > Still fighting with install of singularity new version (install process
      looks ugly and dependending on .bashrc !)

      > Fixed with AUR, check [[file:~/org/my_manual.org::*Install]]

*** DONE Use CookieCutter and add first documentation :0.4:
    CLOSED: [2019-07-04 Thu 13:05] SCHEDULED: <2019-07-04 Thu>

    Using CookieCutter and Sphinx

*** TODO Add preliminary tests
    SCHEDULED: <2019-07-04 Thu>

- Adding notebook test: can get inspiration from
  https://github.com/diana-hep/pyhf/blob/master/tests/test_notebooks.py
  or
  https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/testing-notebooks/701

*** NEXT

- Actually, the rules added using jinja templates could be replaced by one
  "papermill rule" which would run papermill on each notebook. Check how to
  refactor that.

  > But maybe better in case we want to trace the input/outputs of each
  notebooks through snakemake later on.

- Create an index/webpage linkin all html ( a jupyter notebook ? a django server ?)

- Integrate voila server ?
